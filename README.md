A highly customizable twitch bot.

Written because of my frustration with the https://github.com/aidanrwt/twitch-bot .
Can be considered inspired by it, but written from scratch.

The bot is supposed to be customizable to great extent, being more like a simple-ish IRC wrapper to allow simpler interaction with Twitch chat via Python.

Written with a specific person in mind, it can be easily modified for your needs. Contact me if you'd like a personally tailored version.

*Expect to see an API guide or something like that here later
Or just read the code. I hope to make it understandable and well-documented.*
